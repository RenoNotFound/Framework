# Framework

### It is a custom Framework written in php. Handles routes and incoming http requests as well as template engine, superglobals and database connections.

At first you have to load some data to user table because the register feature is not functioning, only the login for speeding up the process. The authentication proccess is solved with sessions.

I used bootstrap to style the pages.
